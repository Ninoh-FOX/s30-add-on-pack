# PocketGo S30 Add-On Pack 
by onionsaregross (http://retrogamecorps.com)

## Introduction

This add-on pack will create new wallpapers for all of your systems, increase the number of systems available on your device, and organize the menu into a logical hierarchy: Nintendo systems (by order of release and consoles before handhelds), Sega systems, Sony systems, NEC systems, then outlying handhelds (Neo Geo Pocket, Wonderswan).

This pack also includes updated emulators (RetroArch cores) with pre-configured screen settings and ideal aspect ratios for emulation accuracy.

This add-on pack assumes that you have already backed up the stock SD card that came with your device.  The user accepts all responsibility for exploded microSD cards or S30 devices.

## Instructions

1. Insert your S30 microSD card into your computer.
2. UPDATE WALLPAPERS:  On your SD card, go to the skins/Default/wallpapers folder, and remove those files.  You can store them on your computer for safe-keeping if you'd like.  Open the 'wallpapers' folder from this pack, and place the png files in the skins/Default/wallpapers folder.
3. UPDATE LAUNCH FILES:  On your SD card, go to the sections/emulators folder, and remove those files.  You can store them on your computer for safe-keeping if you'd like.  Open the 'emulators' folder from this pack, and place the files in the sections/emulators folder.
4. UPDATE EMULATORS.  On your SD card, go to the 'emus' folder, and remove the 'retro' folder.  You can store it on your computer for safe-keeping if you'd like.  Place the new 'retro' folder from this pack into the emus folder.  Then, unzip the file named "unzip_and_add_to_retro_folder.zip", and add its contents to the new retro folder on your SD card.
5. VERIFY ROMS FOLDERS: On your SD card, go to the 'roms' folder and change the folder names so they are as follows (minus the information in the parenthesis).  Also, delete the folder named "npg", this is an unecessary folder.  You will need to create new folders for some systems, and rename some others:
